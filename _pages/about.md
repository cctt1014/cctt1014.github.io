I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Younghyun Kim, where I work in the Networked and Embedded Intelligent Systems Lab. My research focuses on efficient machine learning and hardware-software co-design for privacy-preserving ML, with an emphasis on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and domain-specific accelerators.


I received my BEng in Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore. My recent work includes profiling CKKS implementations, optimizing key FHE operations such as automorphism and NTT, and designing scalable stochastic hardware architectures for AI workloads. I was honored to receive the 2025 DAC Young Fellowship and Emerging Contributor Award.
