In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

Most interrupts are external while there are still a few internal interrupts under RISC-V architecture. <em>e.g. Clock tick, network packet</em></p> <p>Interrupts and exceptions are <strong>precise</strong> when it is clearly associated with specific instructions^[2]. Therefore, all instructions before the faulty instructions could be completely executed with the faulty instruction address stored in SEPC/MEPC (will be elaborated in 2. RISC-V Implementation). <strong>Imprecise</strong> interrupts and exceptions are not associated with instructions, the faulty instruction will be determined by operating system. Consequently, The address stored in SEPC/MEPC is from the latest instruction in the pipeline.</p> <h1 id="2-trap-handling-implementation"><strong>2. Trap Handling Implementation</strong></h1> <h2 id="21-csr---controlstatus-register">2.1. CSR - Control/Status Register</h2> <p>To assist the trap handling, a subset of CSRs is utilized to record the trap-related information <em>(e.g. The cause of trap)</em>. In this section, CSRs related to trap handling will be listed. Detailed introduction for CSR can be found in <a href="https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/">RISC-V Spec Volume 2</a>.</p> <p>Note that in RISC-V, each mode has its own set of CSRs (M: Machine; S: Supervisor; U: User/Application), and the bit width of CSR is determined by XLEN macro which has various configurations. <em>e.g. MEPC is for M-mode and SEPC is for S-mode. MXLEN for M-mode.</em></p> <p>CSRs relevant to trap handling in this post can be found at the end. Let’s trace through the handlers to see how RISC-V handling those unexpected events!</p> <h2 id="22-basic-trap-handling-process">2.2. Basic Trap Handling Process</h2> <p>In general, trap handling begins with its trap entry, which functions like an entrance to the “trap handling” park. The trap entry label is written in assembly code, while the handler is written in C. When the control is transfered to OS (ie. trap triggered), the program counter pointed to the address labeled <strong>trap entry</strong> in assembly.</p> <p><strong>Sample code for trap handler in machine mode</strong> is shown below^[3].</p> <p>RISC-V Assembly interrupt handler to Push and Pop register file</p> <pre><code class="language-assembly">  .align 2

</code></pre></div></div> <p>After getting to the “trap handling” park, to preserve user registers’ values before the content switching, they are stored into the kernel stack. After getting into the handle_trap() function in C, the cause of the trap is identified based on the value in CSR <strong>mcause</strong>. According to the type of cause, specific handler is called to further handle the trap. When the handler program is done, control is passed back to assembly side to restore the values in user registers. Finally, <strong>mret</strong> instruction is used to go back to user mode execution.</p> <p><img src="/images/trap_flow.png" alt="Trap Handling Flow"/></p> <h2 id="23-variations">2.3. Variations</h2> <p>The description of the handling process above is pretty generic, and many detailed configurations of the process are varied. For instance, CSR <strong>mtvec</strong> is holding the base address of the trap entry and configuring the way to access trap handler. When it in direct mode (MODE 0), all exceptions set pc to BASE. When it is vectored mode (MODE 1), asynchronous interrupts set pc to BASE+4×cause. One more example, return instruction <strong>mret</strong> may not jump back to user mode, as it can also switch to another privileged mode based on configuration.</p> <p>Maybe I will further edit this post one day to introduce more about it or you can checkout those trap-related CSRs in <a href="https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/">RISC-V Spec Volume 2</a> to explore :D</p> <h2 id="24-relevant-csrs-list">2.4. Relevant CSRs List</h2> <ul> <li>Cause Register (<strong>mcause</strong>/<strong>scause</strong>): The highest bit (mcause[XLEN-1]) indicates this is caused by exception (0) or interrupt (1). The rest of bits (mcause[XLEN-2:0]) are holding the cause of the trap.</li> <li>Trap-Vector Base-Address Register (<strong>mtvec</strong>/<strong>stvec</strong>): read/write register that holds trap vector configuration, consisting of a vector base address (BASE) and a vector mode (MODE).</li> <li>Machine Exception Program Counter (<strong>mepc</strong>/<strong>sepc</strong>): Holds the address of the instruction which will be executed after current trap handling.</li> </ul> <h1 id="3-references"><strong>3.
